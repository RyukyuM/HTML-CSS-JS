# HTML-CSS-JS
My first web projects 
My main goal is to learn how to create website from nothing.

09.03.2020 Started learning HTML/CSS, slowly because I'm focusing in C++ at the moment, but consistently.

24.03.2020 Welcome my first website which includes most of things which i learned during this period (DarkLord.html)
